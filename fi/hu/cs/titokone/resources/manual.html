<h2><a name="install">2 Installing Titokone</a></h3>
<br>
<p> 
First part is about installing the Titokone. If you've already done that, then
you can move directly to the <a href="#doables">Titokone functions</a>.

<h3> 2.1 Getting and installing Java</h3>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Titokone is a TTK-91 machine language simulator written in Java. To
run Titokone, you need a Java virtual machine (minimum version 1.4.2)
installed. You can download an implementation of the Java virtual
machine at <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>. Follow their installation instructions.
</p>
<p>
It may be slightly difficult to find what you want at Sun's Java
pages. To install just the virtual machine, look for "JRE", to install
the development environment as well for making your own Java programs
or for creating new translations for Titokone, look for "SDK". At the
time of writing this, J2SE version 1.4.2, both SDK and JRE (the 2 is
the platform number, version number is different) could be downloaded
from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Note that on the University of Helsinki, CS department, Java SDK 1.4.2
or newer has been installed already, so you only need to install Java
if you want to use Titokone at eg. your home machine.

<h3> 2.2 Getting Titokone </h3>
</td>
</tr>
</table>



<p>
You can get Titokone via the Tietokoneen toiminta (Computer Organization) 
course homepage, currently at
<a  h ref="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/teemu.kerola/tito/">
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/teemu.kerola/tito/</a>. You can choose between downloading the JAR 
package containing Titokone(titokone.jar) directly or downloading a ZIP file which contains the
JAR file itself along with some instructions and helper programs. 
</p>

<h3> 2.3 Installing Titokone </h3>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<h4>
Quick installation (Windows, Linux, etc)
</h4>
</p>

<p>
For those who know how to manage JAR packages directly, fetching
titokone.jar is sufficient. (JAR is a package format; if you have an
up-to-date version of WinZip, you should be able to open them; in Linux,
use the command 'jar' - see below.) No installation is required; you can
run the jar file directly. For example, in Windows you must execute the
command
<pre>java.exe -jar titokone.jar</pre>

in the directory where you stored the titokone.jar package. 
In Linux, you must execute the command
</p>

<pre> java -jar titokone.jar </pre>
<p>
to run the program. You must have Java installed and on your execution
path. 
</p>


<h4>Almost-as-quick installation in Windows</h4>
<p>
Download titokone.zip and unpack it to the target directory of your
choosing. (The package creates a subdirectory called 'titokone'.) To
run Titokone, go to the subdirectory and double-click on the titokone
BAT (MS-DOS Batch) file. You can tell titokone.bat apart from the
titokone.jar file by its icon; titokone.jar usually looks like
something yellow in a screw bench, titokone.bat resembles a cog wheel
inside a window frame. Titokone.sh, a script which starts the program
in Linux, is probably an unknown filetype in Windows.
</p>
<p>
If BAT files have stopped working in Windows MEGAMILLIONSUPER (we have
tested them up to Windows XP), you can probably still somehow run the
command 'java.exe -jar C:\my\path\to\titokone\titokone.jar' via the
Start menu. Replace C:\my\path\to\titokone with the actual path to the
file.
</p>

<h4> Almost-as-quick installation in Linux</h4>
<p>
Download titokone.zip and unpack it (eg. gunzip titokone.zip) to the
target directory of your choosing. (The package creates a subdirectory
called 'titokone'.)  To run Titokone, open a terminal, change to the
directory the zip file opened, and then the 'titokone' subdirectory, 
and run
</p>
<pre>java -jar titokone.jar</pre>
<p>
If typing is tiresome, the zip contains a titokone.sh startup script
for your convenience. You can rename the file to something shorter, 
like tk. Then you just need to run ./tk (or ./titokone.sh if you have 
not renamed it). The script does not change directories, so you must 
either keep it in the same directory as titokone.jar or edit it.
</p>

<h4>Opening the jar (mostly interesting for developers only)</h4>
<p>
If you wish, you can open the jar by running the following command:
</p>
<pre>
  in Windows: It is probably easiest to open the file using WinZip or
              something similar.
  
  in Linux: jar -xvf titokone.jar
</pre>
<p>
The jar package contains the source code and class files, among other
things. If you modify the files, eg. to add a new language file (see the
included manual on how to do this), you should note that the class files
are a part of a Java package (three packages, to be exact).
</p>
<p>
To start the modified program, change to the package root directory (where
the 'fi' subdirectory is located) and run the command:
</p>
<pre>
  in Windows: java.exe fi.hu.cs.titokone.Titokone 
  
  in Linux: java fi.hu.cs.titokone.Titokone
</pre>
<p>
Javadoc of the classes is included in javadoc/. To compile files
(needed for eg. adding new language support), you need Java SDK, JRE
is not sufficient.
</p>

When opening a file with a b91 extension, you will see the

<h3> 3.2 Editing the source code</h3>
</a>
</td>

<p>The source code can be edited in Titokone as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> Open a file with k91 as its file extension. </li>
<p>Either</p>
<li> Click on the source code line with the left mouse button, at
which point there will be no cursor visible, but the line can be
written on.</li>
<p><img src="img/this.jpg"></p>
<p>or</p>
<li> Double-click on the source code line with the left mouse, at
which point a cursor will appear on the line.</li>
<p><img src="img/orthis.jpg"></p>
<li> Make the necessary changes on the line. </li>
<li> Confirm the changes by pressing enter. </li>
<li> The changes are stored in the original file. </li>
</ul>

 <p>We recommend editing the source code in a separate program,
 however. There have been problems with the result getting stored in
 some other, recently opened k91 file. See <a href="#paranoid">our
 troubleshooting section on this</a>.

  <li> Using a variable: If a symbol (or a label) is used in the
  command on the line and the symbol is not in the symbol table yet,
  it is added.</li>
  <li> Finding a label: If there is a label in the start of a line,
  the label and the line number are added to the symbol table.</li>
  <li> A compilation error: The compilation is aborted, the error is
  reported to the user and, once the user clicks the "Continue"
  button, the source code view is restored.</li>

  <p> The titokone memory can be emptied by selecting File --> Erase

  <a href="Openview.html">opening view</a>, with registers, symbol
  table and code view have been emptied. Memory can be erased using the shortcut key CTRL-E.</p>
  <p>Unless the memory is erased or its size is changed, the remnants

</pre>

<p>
In the symbolic machine language, the commands are of the form
</p>

<pre>LABEL OPER Rj,M ADDR(Ri)

where  OPER    the symbolic name of the command
       Rj      the first operand (register R0..R7)
       M       addressing mode:
               =   immediate operand
                   direct addressing (empty, ie. not marked)
               @   indirect addressing
       ADDR    address part (memory address or constant value)
       Ri      possible index register (register R0..R7)        
</pre>
<p>
If some part of a command has no meaning, it can be left out. It is 
possible to add a label (symbolic address) in front of a command. The 
label should consist of the letters A-Ö, 0-9 and _, and contain at 
least one non-numerical character. Only the first 8 characters are
considered.
</p>
<p>
Almost all commands have the following forms available:
</p>
<pre>
   OPER Rj,ADDR        direct memory addressing
   OPER Rj,=ADDR       immediate operand
   OPER Rj,@ADDR       indirect memory addressing
   OPER Rj,ADDR(Ri)    indexed addressing
   OPER Rj,=ADDR(Ri)   indexed immediate operand
   OPER Rj,@ADDR(Ri)   indexed indirect memory addressing      
   OPER Rj,Ri          direct register addressing
</pre>
<p>
There are exceptions:
</p>
<pre>
    STORE           The latter operand is always the target address;
                    it cannot be a register or a constant value.
    POP             The latter operand must always be a register.   
    JUMP COMMANDS   The latter operand is always the target address;
                    it cannot be a constant. In the jump commands which
                    look at the state register, the first operand is  
                    ignored.               
    NOP             The operands are ignored.  
</pre>
    

<br>
<h3>
		4.2 The symbolic commands of the TTK-91 machine language
</h3>

<p>
Data transfer commands:
</p>

<pre>
LOAD   Stores the value of the latter operand to the register Rj.
STORE  Stores the integer in Rj as the value of the latter operand.    
IN     Reads an integer from the device given as the latter operand 
       into the register Rj (eg. IN R1,=KBD to read from the keyboard).
OUT    Outputs the integer in the register Rj to the device given as 
       the latter operand (eg. OUT R1,=CRT to print to screen).
</pre>
<p>
Arithmetic and logical commands:
</p>

<pre>
The result of the calculation is stored in register Rj.

ADD    Adds the value of the latter operand to the integer in the
       register Rj.
SUB    Substracts the value of the latter operand from the integer in 
       the register Rj.
MUL    Multiplies the integer in the register Rj with the value of the
       latter operand.
DIV    Divides the integer in the register Rj with the value of the 
       latter operand, and stores the whole part in Rj.
MOD    Modulo divides the integer in the register Rj with the value of
       the latter operand, and stores the remainder in Rj.
AND    Boolean logic 'and' between Rj and the value of the latter operand.
OR     Boolean logic 'or' between Rj and the value of the latter operand.
XOR    Boolean logic 'exclusive or' between Rj and the value of the
       latter operand.
SHL    Shifts the bits of the register Rj left, with the number of
       shifts given by the value of the latter operand. Fills the
       right end with 0 bits.
SHR    Shifts the bits on the register Rj right, otherwise like SHL.
SHRA   Performs an arithmetic right shift; as in SHR, but fills the
       left end with copies of the leftmost bit, thus keeping negative
       numbers negative.

COMP   Compares the first operand with the second operand and stores
       the result in the status register SR's bits L=less, E=equal,
       G=greater. See eg. JLES.
</pre>
<p>
Forking commands:
</p>

<pre>
JUMP   An unconditional jump to the target address expressed by the
       second operand.

JNEG   Jump if negative. If Rj &lt; 0, jumps to the address given as the
       second operand, otherwise continues with the next command.
JZER   Jump if zero,      ie. if Rj = 0
JPOS   Jump if positive,      if Rj &gt; 0
JNNEG  Jump if not negative,  if Rj &gt;= 0
JNZER  Jump if not zero,      if Rj &lt;&gt; 0
JNPOS  Jump if not positive,  if Rj &lt;= 0

JLES   Jump if less - if the status register SR has its L bit set,
       jumps to the address given as the second operand, otherwise
       continues from the next command. Used together with the COMP 
       command.
JEQU   Jump if equal,      ie. if E bit is set in SR
JGRE   Jump if greater,        if G bit is set in SR
JNLES  Jump if not less,       if E or G bit is set in SR
JNEQU  Jump if not equal       if L or G bit is set in SR 
JNGRE  Jump if not greater     if L or E bit is set in SR
</pre>

<p>
Stack commands:
</p>

<p>
The first operand of the command, the register Rj, points to the top
of the stack, ie. the topmost item in it. Usually, the register SP
(which is also R6) is used as the stack pointer.
</p>

<pre>
PUSH   Increases the stack pointer Rj's value by one and stores the latter
       operand as the topmost item in the stack.

POP    Removes the topmost item in the stack and stores it as the  
       register Ri (the latter operand is always a register). Substracts
       one from the stack pointer Rj.           

PUSHR  Pushes the registers R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 (SP) to the 
       stack, in this order. Before pushing each register, increases the
       stack pointer Rj's value by one.

POPR   Pops values to the registers R6 (SP), R5, R4, R3, R2, R1 and
       R0, in this order, from the stack. For each pop, first fetches
       the value from the top of the stack indicated by the register  
       Rj, and then substracts one from Rj.
</pre>

<p>
Subroutine commands:
</p>

<pre>
CALL   Call procedure. Moves the control (by manipulating the program 
       counter) to the address given by the latter operand. Stores the
       return address to the stack, with its top indicated by Rj.
EXIT   Returns from a procedure to the command following its call. The
       return address is found from the stack, the top of which Rj
       points to. The latter operand indicates the number of parameters
       passed to the subroutine in the call.
</pre>
      
<p> 
System calls:  
</p>

<pre>
SVC    Supervisor call. Calls a service routine in the operating system.
       The first operand is Rj, indicating the top of the stack, the 
       latter operand gives the number identifying the service.
       Supervisor calls are special subroutine calls to predefined 
       procedures. Their code is invisible to the user, and is considered
       to be stored "outside" the memory space.

       Service identifiers:

       HALT : Stops the execution of the program.
       TIME : Gives the time of day. The stack should contain the 
              addresses to store the hour, minute and second values.
              Note their order!
       DATE : Gives the date. The stack should contain the addresses 
              to store the year, month and day values. Note their order!
       READ : Reads an integer from the keyboard. The stack should 
              contain the address to store the integer to.
       WRITE: Prints an integer to the screen. The stack should
              contain the value to print.
</pre>

<h3>
		4.5 Instructions to the compiler (fake commands)
</h3>

<p>
The compiler instructions direct the program translating the symbolic
machine language to binary. They are NOT actual symbolic commands.
</p>
<pre>
name EQU value
</pre>
<p>
The alias command EQU defines a symbolic name for an integer
value. The symbol name can be used in the ADDR field of a command, in
which case it will be handled as 'value' written in its stead
would be.
</p>
<pre>
name DC value
</pre>
<p>
The memory allocation command DC (data constant) allocates one word of
memory for a constant, aliases 'name' with the constant's memory
address and stores 'value' in the allocated address in the
memory. 'Name' can then be used in a command's ADDR field as a
memory address.
</p>

<pre>
name DS size
</pre>
<p>
The memory allocation command DS (data segment) allocates an area of
memory, sized 'size' words. It aliases 'name' with the start address
of the memory area. 'Name' can then be used in a command's ADDR field
as a memory address. This instruction is used for allocating space for
global variables.
</p>

<pre>
option DEF string
</pre>
<a name="stdindef">
<p>
This special instruction changes options for simulating the file
system of a TTK-91 machine. 'String' should be an absolute directory 
path.
</p>
</a>

<p>
Examples: 
</p>
<pre>
  STDIN DEF /home/myuser/ttk91/stdin
  STDOUT DEF C:\mydir\stdout
</pre>
<p>
Available options are:
</p>

<pre>
  STDIN   To set which file stdin data is read from.
  STODUT  To set which file stdout data is written to.
  HOME    To set the user's home directory for this application;
          unused in Titokone as the home directory is requested from
          the underlying operating system via the Java virtual machine.
</pre>

<p>
The default files for the two first options are stdin and stdout in
the user's current working directory.
</p>
<p>
If this summary of the Titokone commands was not sufficient for your
thirst of knowledge, you can find more information about the subject 
from the course homepage of <a
href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/kerola/tito/">Computer organization</a>.
</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="extension">5. Fine-tuning and extending the system</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="settings_files">5.1 Settings files</a></h3>

<p>
When the user changes the settings, Titokone stores the changes in the
user's home directory, in a file called titokone.cfg. The settings
file is overwritten after every change in the settings.
</p>
<p>
If Titokone has been opened from its jar package, the system default
settings can be found in the file 
fi/hu/cs/titokone/etc/settings.cfg. The file contents are as follows:
</p>
<pre>
   # Default settings. Running mode: commented (+1), one row at a time (+2),
   # but not animated (+4) compilation mode: commented (+1) but not
   # one happening at a time (+2). Stdin and stdout file paths given are
   # relative to the current working directory. 'Stdout use' describes that
   # the file should be used in append mode ('append') instead of
   # overwriting ('overwrite') it for every new run. Memory size is 2^9 =
   # 512 lines.
   Language = English
   Running mode = 3
   Compilation mode = 1
   Stdin file = stdin
   Stdin path = relative
   Stdout file = stdout
   Stdout path = relative
   Stdout use = append
   Memory size = 9
</pre>
<p>
Changing the settings file by hand is not usually necessary. On the
other hand, the STDIN and STDOUT file paths are always stored in the
file as absolute paths, when they have been selected from the Titokone
user interface. If you wish to express the path in relation to the
working directory, you can do so by setting "Stdin path" or "Stdout
path" values to 'relative', like they are above.
</p>
<p>
In addition, also inside the jar package in fi/hu/cs/titokone/etc/, 
there is the language settings file languages.cfg. This file contains
a list of the language files which have been added to be a part of the
system. They are listed in the language choosing file based on the
language's name given here. The language files themselves are located
in the fi/hu/cs/titokone/resources/ directory. They are called
Translations_xx.class and are part of the package
fi.hu.cs.titokone.resources. The language file consists of pairs of
the form "the name of the language in the menu" = "xx". The value "xx"
should be a two-letter identifier for the language (it is passed to
the constructor of java.util.Locale). The contents of the default
language settings file are:
</p>
<pre>
   Suomi = fi
   English = en
</pre>

 
  
  
  
  <h3><a name="addlanguage">5.2 Adding support for a new language</a></h3>
<p> Adding a new natural language support to Titokone is done by
giving translated equivalents to the words and phrases in the default
language, which is English. A new Java file is written and compiled
for the new language, and it is opened via the Titokone user
interface. Writing a new language file is simplest done by using an
existing translation file as an example. First open a text editor on
your machine and fetch eg. the file Translations_fi.java from the
directory fi/hu/cs/titokone/resources (included in the titokone.jar
package). You will see a class which uses the Java ResourceBundle
utilities and consists of a two-dimensional Object array and a method
which returns it. The lines in the array look as follows:</p>

<pre>
   { "Fetch second operand from memory slot {0}.", "Nouda jälkimmäinen operandi muistipaikasta {0}."},
   { "Indirect memory addressing mode.", "Epäsuora muistiosoitus."},
   { "1: Fetch indexing value from memory slot {0}.", "1: Nouda indeksointiarvo muistipaikasta {0}."}, 
</pre>
<p> 
Each line consists of a pair of quote-delimited strings inside
{}-brackets; the first string is the default language's key value and the
second its translation equivalent. You translate the original string
by replacing the latter (here Finnish) text. Usually you can determine
the meaning of the sentence somehow from itself. To help translators
with the more vague phrases, we have pointed out in comments which
class file the translation refers to. If it turns out to be difficult
to determine the meaning of a translateable string, you can find the
context from the source code of the class, which may eg. help
determine the meaning of the variable ({i}) placed in the translation.
</p>
<p>
In the example translations below, there is a special sequence of
characters, '{0}'. It will be replaced with a variable, which is
attached to the message passing up to the user interface. In the
example, the {0} will be replaced with the number of the memory
slot. The translation does not have to place the variable in the same
place as the original string; you can move the '{0}' around in the
sentence. For example:
<pre>
//Animator
{ "Fetch second operand from memory slot {0}.", "Nouda jälkimmäinen operandi muistipaikasta {0}."},
-->
//Animator
{ "Fetch second operand from memory slot {0}.", "Muistipaikasta {0} noudetaan jälkimmäinen operandi."},
</pre>
<p>A new language file is created as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li> Open Translations_fi.java.</li>
<li> Save the file by a name you most prefer, but keep the .java
ending.</li>
<li> Write the translation equivalents over the Finnish texts.</li>
<li> Place the variables {0}...{n} in sensible positions in the sentence</li>
<li> Remove line 4 from the file, which says 'package fi.hu.cs.titokone.resources;'.</li>
<li> Change the class name to correspond with the filename you stored
the file as.</li>
<li> Compile the file, eg. by using the javac command</li>
<li> Start Titokone </li>
<li><a href="#changelanguage">Change the language</a> </li>
</ol>
<p>
You can also add the new language as a permanent part of the system,
which relieves you from needing to find the translation file again
every time. In point 2, store the file in the directory
fi/hu/cs/titokone/resources with the other translation files. Change
the class's name, on the line
</p>
<pre>
public class Translations_fi {
</pre>
<p>to be Translations_xx according to your translated language ('xx'),
and store it in a file called Translations_xx.java. Replace 
'xx' with the ISO-code of your target language (those versions of ISO
639 that Java's Locale supports). For example, if you translated the
program into Norwegian, the code would be 'no', and the corresponding
code for German would be 'de'. <b>Do not remove (like point 4 advices)
the package definition line</b>; it is needed for this.
</p>
<p>
When your translation is finished and it has a compiled .class file,
install it by editing the language setup file
fi/hu/cs/titokone/etc/languages.cfg and add a line containing "what
the language should be called in the menu" = "xx", where you again
replace xx with your language code. For example, "Deutsch = de". See
also <a href="#settings_files">5.1, Settings files</a>. Now, once you
start Titokone the next time, the new language will be included as an
option in the menu.

  <a name="thread"><b>I see odd Java error messages in the terminal I
  started Titokone from. The program itself does not seem to mind,
  though. What is going on?</b></a>
   <div>
   The programs are mainly caused by the wrong positioning of the
  Moon. A partial reason are problems with synchronization, which we
  might have avoided if we had paid more attention on the Concurrent
  systems course. Some of the errors are caused by probable bugs (or
  very odd features) of Swing, a graphics library in Java, which we
  cannot fix. Sorry about those, just ignore the messages for now.</div>

  <br>
  <a name="stdinerror"><b>I get an error message about not being able
  to read the STDIN file, even though the program I just loaded
  doesn't even try to read it. What's wrong?</b></a>
  <div>
  Titokone is just notifying you in advance, that if you try to read
  the STDIN device with a TTK-91 program, the read will fail unless
  something is done about this. There is a specification of the error
  message given by the Java I/O system in the end of the error
  message. If your application should need the STDIN device, fix what
  is wrong with reading the file and reload the application. See also
  <a href="#loading">3.5, Loading a TTK-91 program</a>.</div>

  <br>  
   <a name="comptwo"><b>My program had an incorrect line
   of code; I tried to use a variable which was undefined. The error
   message showed up right, but the line is not emphasised
   correctly. What's up?</b></a>
  
  <div>In the second phase, when object code is generated, the
  line containing the error is not emphasized if it is the first
  line. Sorry about the bug.
  </div>
 
  <br>
  <a name="selfcode"><b>I made a wonderful program, which contains
  self-modifying code. The first time I ran the program, the changed
  code remains on the code area. This isn't how the real machines
  work, is it?</b></a>
 <div>Unfortunately Titokone 1.0 has a bug, which causes the code area
  to not be redrawn during the reload of the application after a
  finished run. This means that self-changed code is shown wrong,
  even though it is loaded correctly on the processor.</div>
 
 
 <br>
  <a name="chosen"><b>The compilation ended in an error on the first
  round, but I cannot edit the code! The row that caused the error
  remains selected.</b></a>

  <div>After an error, Titokone shows the situation which lead into
  the error. When you press the 'continue' button or the enter key,
  you will move from compilation mode back to the source code view, in
  which you can edit the code.</div>

  <br>

  <a name="paranoid"><b>I opened several source code files in
  Titokone, modified a few of them and now one of the files is
  overwritten by another! Am I just paranoid?</b></a>
   <div>No, you are not imagining it. It is caused by a nasty bug,
   which we did not manage to locate in Titokone version 1.0. You can
   avoid the problem by editing the files in other programs (larger
   edits must be done elsewhere in any case), or by not opening
   multiple files with Titokone. We are very sorry about the
   problem. You can show this part of the manual to your excercise
   checker if he will not believe you when you tell him that "Titokone
   ate my homework!" (This explanation, however, probably only works once.)
   </div>


<br>

<a name="variable"><b>I am getting the compilation error "invalid
opcode dc" (or ds or equ) when I use - correctly, as far as I see - 
"variable dc 333333333333333".</b></a>
<div>When the latter number is large enough, the compiler fails to
notice a valid dc command with a too large number (the maximum number
for DC is 2^31-1, or 2147483647), but it tries to interpret the
command in the form "label command parameters", which causes the odd
error message. Clarifying the message is on the list of improvements
to make for the second version of Titokone.</div>

<br><a name="animazion"><b> When I turn on the animation setting, the
row-wise execution setting is turned on too. I can't turn off row-wise
execution without stopping the animation as well. What's wrong?</b></a>
<div>To make following the animation easier and to ease
synchronization problems, we decided to conduct the animation one
command ("row") at a time. This means that row-wise execution is
always required to be on together with animation.</div>

<br>

<b><a name="R0">The register R0 doesn't work? I loaded 14 into R0, now
I am trying to read it, but all I get is zero. Is this caused by the
2's complement?</a></b>
<div>According to the TTK-91 specification, the register R0 has a
special meaning. When it occurs as a second parameter, 0 is always
returned, even if the register itself contains something else. We are
sorry for the possible confusion.</div>
<br>

<a name="spfp"><b>The animation window has no SP or FP!</b></a>
<div>The SP register is also known as R6, and FP as R7. They are
    included the animation window by this name; this can be adjusted
    from the translation if necessary.</div>
<br>

<b><a name="help">Further problems or ideas?</a></b>
<div>If the problem you have observed was not described here, please
notify eg. a lecturer of the Computer organization (Tietokoneen
toiminta) course, and ask them to pass the message on. 
Bug reports are also welcome.</div>
