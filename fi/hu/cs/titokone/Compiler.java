/* Antti: 04.03.04
Do a pure binary translation first, then when all sections are complete, convert the binary to an 
integer. Needs variables for opcode(8bit), first operand(3 bit)(r0 to r7), m-part(memory format, 
direct, indirect or from code), possible index register (3 bit) and 16 bits for the address.
Once STORE is converted to a 00000001 and the rest of the code processed we get 32bit binary that
is the opcode from symbolic opcode.

Antti 08.03.04
Teemu said that we should support the machine spec instead of Koksi with this one. No need to 
support opcodes like Muumuu LOAD R1, 100 kissa etc. Only tabs and extra spacing. So 
we need to support opcodes like LOAD R1,           100 but not codes like LOAD R1, =R2.

Basic functionality: (Trim between each phase.) 
	Check if there is a label (8 first are the meaningful ones also must have one non-number))
	Convert opcode (8bit)
	check which register (0 to 7)
	=, Rj/addr or @ (00, 01 or 10)
	if addr(Ri) or Rj(Ri)(0 to 7)
	convert address (16bit)
	check if the rest is fine (empty of starts with ;)

	Store both formats to a data array (symbolic and binary).
