/** This class contains the intellect the GUI class needs to provide 
    services to the Control class. It also hides the GUI and Control from
    each other, serving as the middle-man for all their communication. It
    prepares all the data from CompileInfo, LoadInfo and RunInfo objects
    to GUI, so that it doesn't have to be aware of what's happening behind
    GUIBrain. Moreover, this class for its part doesn't take any position on 
    how to show the data provided here on the screen. It may, however, tell 
    GUI to disable or enable some elements or objects, such as buttons, 
    menuitems or inputfields.
